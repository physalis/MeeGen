INTRODUCTION:
=============
MeeGen (name not final) is an easy to use designer
for custom Meego avatars (wiki.meego.com/Meegons).
It was designed to run and flawlessly integrate in 
the MeeGo netbook UX, though due to the nature of
mono's CLR, it should work on most modern UNIX/Linux 
distributions that fullfill the requirements 
(see next section).

REQUIREMENTS:
=============
MeeGen (and MeegonComponentDB respectively) was written
using C# and targets the mono CIL runtime. Therefore it
requires a modern Unix/Linux distibution and, though not 
tested, at least the mono-core package. The following
table summarizes al requirements for running or compiling
MeeGen:

o Mono JIT compiler (tested with version 2.6.7) 
o Gtk# (gtk-sharp2)
o Cairo (Mono.Cairo is part of the mono-core package)
o RSVG (librsvg2 [Dynamic Link Library available @ MeeGen/MeeGen/bin/lib/]

o gmcs (for compiling the source code)

Note: The CIL bindings require the native version of
      the mentioned libraries (gtk#, cairo, rsvg) to be installed.
      
INSTALLATION:
=============
Will add makefiles soon.
