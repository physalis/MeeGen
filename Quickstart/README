Besides a recent mono version you'll also need (debian names):

gtk-sharp2
librsvg2-2.18-cil (available as local .dll in this folder)
librsvg2-2

INSTALLATION:
=============

chmod +x create-database.sh
./create-database.sh // extract image files and create ComponentDB.xml
mono MeeGen.exe // you should start the app from the terminal to see exception & crash output.
