Move a layer with your left mouse button pressed.
Scale a layer with your right mouse button down 
(not the final solution, because it is not properly working on touchscreens)


Besides a recent mono version you'll also need:

libgtk2.0-cil   (contains pango-sharp & gdk-sharp)
libglib2.0-cil
librsvg2-2.18-cil

On MeeGo, you don't have to install additional packages, just make
sure that your system is updated.

INSTALLATION:
=============
